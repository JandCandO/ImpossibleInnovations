0.8.7.2:
	Fixed the dead weight's bottom node to have a negative angle. I checked, and that's the last one. (Hopefully)

	Updated the included Module Manager version.

0.8.7.1:
	Recomplie code for KSP version 1.0.4

	Latest versions of Module Manager and Tweakscale included

	The Tweakscale that comes with Impossible Innovations now only has configs for Impossible Innovations. If you want all the stock configs, go install Tweakscale.

0.8.7:
The standard fusion engine is no longer buggy.

All resources have a specific heat capacity value now.

0.8.6:
Plugin recompiled for KSP 1.0.2

All bottom nodes corrected to an angle of -1 instead of 1

New Ionized Wing varieties (delta, small delta, and boards A-C)

Old Ion Wing moved to legacy folder. It will load in old ships, but is not visible in editor

Ionized Wings now display their current lift and electric consumption

Ionized Wings no longer explode when there is no electricCharge, now they set their lift to less than a normal wing's

Editor scene filters for Impossible Innovations (with a little icon I made)

all stock counterpart textures switched to .dds. Now I can edit them to stand out!

Added a CL-20 booster that looks like Squad's "flea" booster

Hydrogen intake is nerfed slightly

Some .dds textures like the dense solar panel are edited to make them different from stock

Tech tree that is compatible with KSP 1.0 - no longer needs TechManger

0.8.5:
Added a CL-20 sepatron

All code recompliled for KSP v0.90

Fixed up the code for the hydrogen converter. There shouldn't be any more issues.

Nerfed hydrogen intake to 1/4 of its previous performance.

0.8:
Added a stable, but unbalanced tech tree, powered by TechManager!

New models for aluminum strut, iridium strut, radial battery pack, and the x8 deuterium tank!

Radial battery is now rescalable.

Fixed the positions of a few placement nodes.

All nodes are now size 1! That means no more massive 3-meter nodes on a tiny 1-meter part.

Support for the Addon Version Checker by cybutek was added! It isn't in the release package, but the option to monitor the version of this mod is now available if you want to do it. Just install AVC.

4-Kerbal command pod now uses tritium instead of ElectricCharge for torque. The weak RTG is still in place, though.

The 4-Kerbal command pod's IVA was removed due to weird clipping stuff while inside.

0.7:
ADDED FEATURES:

	Included TweakScale in Impossible Innovations. This drastically changed the part layout. Here's the new system:
		Engines:
			There are only 4 deuterium engines now; a standard model, a standard radial model, a High-Efficiency model, and a Low-Efficiency model.
			Added a new CL-20 booster and tweaked lots of the engine settings for all CL-20 boosters.
			ALL engines are fully rescalable from 0.625m to 7m.
		Tanks:
			There are now only 4 deuterium tanks, varying only in length.
			There are only 2 tritium tanks; a stackable and a radial type.
			ALL tanks are rescalable.

	I added 2 new ships to the VAB ship selection; an Impossible Lander and The Impossible Missle of Doom.

	There is now only 1 dead weight. The dead weight now has a resource called "Lead." Lead adds the correct amount of weight per unit (liter) added to the part. The larger the dead weight is upscaled, the more lead it can hold.

	Engines can now be requested for testing in contracts.

	There are now only 2 kind of rescalable parachutes; a top-stack one and a radial one.

	Solar panels are rescalable.

	TDRCS ports are now rescalable.

	Poofing part is now rescalabe.

	Both probe cores are now rescalable.

	There is now only 1 kind of stackable battery pack.


CHANGED FEATURES / NOTES:

	THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK EVERY SHIP THAT USES IMPOSSIBLE INNOVATIONS PARTS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

	I have left the hydrogen processing system, the reaction wheel system, and the ionized wing out of the TweakScale system for now. They will come eventually.

	I played with lots of part prices and settings.

	The command pod will never be rescalable, and neither will the struts.

	I left the radial battery pack out of the TweakScale system because it will be replaced soon.

REMOVED FEATURES:

	Treeloader is no longer! I will be using TechManager in the next release.

	I removed pretty much every engine and tank, except for the ones currently implemented.

	Removed the Impossible Innovations Heavy craft from the VAB.

0.6.2.1:
Changed GameData file name from "Impossible Innovations" to "ImpossibleInnovations." Very minor. Is intended to make it compatible with CKAN.

0.6.2:
Recompiled for KSP v0.25.

0.6.1:
~Fixed Hydrogen Converter not draining or adding electric charge
~Improved code

0.6:
+Added a Hydrogen Intake
+Added a Hydrogen Tank
+Added a Hydrogen Converter
+Added a Poofing Part
~Ionized wing now drains ElectricCharge
-Removed Mk1-4 Pod interior
-Removed the annoying (II) tag in part names

0.5.1:
~Updated to the .24.2 tech tree.

Was still using old .22 tech tree. That meant no NASA parts! D:

It's all fixed now!

0.5:
+Gave all resources a price
~Re-priced fuel tanks so that an empty tank isn't that expensive
~Reduced reaction wheel torque to something more manageable
~Cleaned up configs so they are neater. Nothing to do with gameplay, but still belongs in the changelog.

0.4:
Patched for .23.5!

Many, many, many bugs and problems are ironed out in this update thanks to Baconator900.

~Made sure none of the parts referenced .DAE models.
~Tweaked dead weights' mass to match that of lead.
-Removed thrust vector engine.
+Added thrust vector capability to the normal engine.
+Added a 2m battery bank.
~Updated Included Treeloader package
~Moved tritium tanks from control to propulsion so people can find them.
~changed the standard engine model to be able to have a gimbal animation
~fixed node locations of the stack probe cores
+some parts got non-stock models. and they look amazing! (models by Dungchunker)
~fixed strut texutres
+added an iridium strut (1/2 length, but much stronger than normal strut)
+added a Heavy Craft to the ships folder

0.3:
Added a tech tree!! �(This took some doing :) )
Nerfed batteries.
Removed deployable solars and replaced them with flat ones (this will break some craft)
Added more command pods.
Made it so my reaction wheels now use tritium instead of electricity.
Added a 2m Reaction Wheel
All command pods use tritium instead of electricity to generate torque.

0.2.6:
Added Tritium-Driven RCS, or TDRCS
Moved �Ships� folder outside of GameData (I derped up before)
Fixed the names and descriptions of some parts
Added names to all the tanks and engines! They are pretty bad names, but at least they are distingushable from each other now.
(Accidentally) changed the texture on the Aluminum Strut! I was trying to clean up the files, and now the strut is pure white; I guess that means there is no texture�I�m just going to go with it. :)

0.2.5.2:
Patched for KSP .21 :D
Fixed some issues regarding parachutes, plus I tweaked them
I did some price balancing :P. You will find the fusion engines unchanged, but the deuterium is now VERY expensive.
I cleaned the files up a bit.
Swapped out the probe engines for their new counterparts in stock KSP (I like the models better)
Added a new tank and a new engine.
I�m sure I tweaked other things, but this is all I can think of.
