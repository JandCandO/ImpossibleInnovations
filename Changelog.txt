0.7:
ADDED FEATURES:
	Included TweakScale in Impossible Innovations. This drastically changed the part layout. Here's the new system:
		Engines:
			There are only 4 deuterium engines now; a standard model, a standard radial model, a High-Efficiency model, and a Low-Efficiency model.
			Added a new CL-20 booster and tweaked lots of the engine settings for all CL-20 boosters.
			ALL engines are fully rescalable from 0.625m to 7m.
		Tanks:
			There are now only 4 deuterium tanks, varying only in length.
			There are only 2 tritium tanks; a stackable and a radial type.
			ALL tanks are rescalable.

	I added 2 new ships to the VAB ship selection; an Impossible Lander and The Impossible Missle of Doom.

	There is now only 1 dead weight. The dead weight now has a resource called "Lead." Lead adds the correct amount of weight per unit (liter) added to the part. The larger the dead weight is upscaled, the more lead it can hold.

	Engines can now be requested for testing in contracts.

	There are now only 2 kind of rescalable parachutes; a top-stack one and a radial one.

	Solar panels are rescalable.

	TDRCS ports are now rescalable.

	Poofing part is now rescalabe.

	Both probe cores are now rescalable.

	There is now only 1 kind of stackable battery pack.


CHANGED FEATURES / NOTES:
	THIS UPDATE WILL BREAK EVERY SHIP THAT USES IMPOSSIBLE INNOVATIONS PARTS, WITHOUT EXCEPTION.

	I have left the hydrogen processing system, the reaction wheel system, and the ionized wing out of the TweakScale system for now. They will come eventually.

	I played with lots of part prices and settings.

	The command pod will never be rescalable, and neither will the struts.

	I left the radial battery pack out of the TweakScale system because it will be replaced soon.

REMOVED FEATURES:
	Treeloader is no longer! I will be using TechManager in the next release.

	I removed pretty much every engine and tank, except for the ones currently implemented.

	Removed the Impossible Innovations Heavy craft from the VAB.

0.6.2.1:
Changed GameData file name from "Impossible Innovations" to "ImpossibleInnovations." Very minor. Is intended to make it compatible with CKAN.

0.6.2:
Recompiled for KSP v0.25.

0.6.1:
~Fixed Hydrogen Converter not draining or adding electric charge
~Improved code

0.6:
+Added a Hydrogen Intake
+Added a Hydrogen Tank
+Added a Hydrogen Converter
+Added a Poofing Part
~Ionized wing now drains ElectricCharge
-Removed Mk1-4 Pod interior
-Removed the annoying (II) tag in part names

0.5.1:
~Updated to the .24.2 tech tree.

Was still using old .22 tech tree. That meant no NASA parts! D:

It's all fixed now!

0.5:
+Gave all resources a price
~Re-priced fuel tanks so that an empty tank isn't that expensive
~Reduced reaction wheel torque to something more manageable
~Cleaned up configs so they are neater. Nothing to do with gameplay, but still belongs in the changelog.

0.4:
Patched for .23.5!

Many, many, many bugs and problems are ironed out in this update thanks to Baconator900.

~Made sure none of the parts referenced .DAE models.
~Tweaked dead weights' mass to match that of lead.
-Removed thrust vector engine.
+Added thrust vector capability to the normal engine.
+Added a 2m battery bank.
~Updated Included Treeloader package
~Moved tritium tanks from control to propulsion so people can find them.
~changed the standard engine model to be able to have a gimbal animation
~fixed node locations of the stack probe cores
+some parts got non-stock models. and they look amazing! (models by Dungchunker)
~fixed strut texutres
+added an iridium strut (1/2 length, but much stronger than normal strut)
+added a Heavy Craft to the ships folder

0.3:
Added a tech tree!! –(This took some doing :) )
Nerfed batteries.
Removed deployable solars and replaced them with flat ones (this will break some craft)
Added more command pods.
Made it so my reaction wheels now use tritium instead of electricity.
Added a 2m Reaction Wheel
All command pods use tritium instead of electricity to generate torque.

0.2.6:
Added Tritium-Driven RCS, or TDRCS
Moved ‘Ships’ folder outside of GameData (I derped up before)
Fixed the names and descriptions of some parts
Added names to all the tanks and engines! They are pretty bad names, but at least they are distingushable from each other now.
(Accidentally) changed the texture on the Aluminum Strut! I was trying to clean up the files, and now the strut is pure white; I guess that means there is no texture…I’m just going to go with it. :)

0.2.5.2:
Patched for KSP .21 :D
Fixed some issues regarding parachutes, plus I tweaked them
I did some price balancing :P. You will find the fusion engines unchanged, but the deuterium is now VERY expensive.
I cleaned the files up a bit.
Swapped out the probe engines for their new counterparts in stock KSP (I like the models better)
Added a new tank and a new engine.
I’m sure I tweaked other things, but this is all I can think of.

0.2.5.1:
Re-Organized the Files for a Near-Effortless Installation

0.2.5:
Finalized Fixing + Added an Updated Impossible Innovations Lander!

0.2.4:
Changed One Last Thing

0.2.3:
Fixed More Overlooked Issues

0.2.2:
Fixed Overlooked Issues

0.2.1:
KSP .20 Patch

0.2:
Expansions to Tanks

Initial Release!
